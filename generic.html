							<p> I’m Aakash Shahani, an 18-year-old boy pursuing his bachelor of information technology at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia. My student number and email address are s3759927 and aakashshahani42@gmail.com respectively. I’m basically from India and my last education was 12th year   and in addition to this I had done C-Programming course from India. As India is the country of cultures and people have different cultures and as per me the culture refers to anything like the way of behaving with other, respecting other religions, tradition of arts, festivals, fairs, dance music are also included in our culture.  In addition to that, many different languages are spoken in different religion and caste. I belong to the Hindu religion, but my caste is Sindhi. So, I have been speaking Sindhi, Hindi, Guajarati and English (As I studied in Convent School) languages since from my childhood. And I had being passionate about football and cricket in sports and I can refer them as my hobby and from the last year I had started reading books on autobiography. They work as a stressbuster for me So, playing sports and reading new books are something that I can’t think life without.</p>
							<p>•	What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? 
From the last few decades, computerization and digitalization has been increasing tremendously. Further, the world wide web, refer as the global information system is loaded with a lot of data and information. In my school life also, I was way ahead at computers, so my teachers motivated and suggested me to choose information technology as a career. They explained me by present scenario of online banking transaction is the good example of the need of secure information system. As the time passed my interest and thirst to attain further education in information technology grew. So, now I am starting my career in Information Technology is because of my school teacher who found that I was capable of doing this and she knew that I had interest in IT.
•	Why did you choose to come to RMIT?
I know as the selection of right candidate is important for the university so is for the student to select the correct university. So of course, such major decision cannot be taken in haste. No doubt, the name RMIT University is enough, but I got the momentum by information from a senior, and a few well-wishers. As I found RMIT University’s undergraduate program in Information technology covers all subjects which I am interested most. However, I must say the real magnet was the research of Professor Ellie Rennie on Cyber safety in remote Aboriginal communities, which I think would undoubtedly help me in strengthening my understanding of cyber security and its’ applications. The quality that has attracted me a lot about your university is, it creates management and leadership qualities necessary to advance career options. The best research facilities, eminent faculty and the vibrant atmosphere of the university have really astonished me.

•	What do you expect to learn during your studies?
I want to acquire all the skills to solve, support, troubleshoot and design, everything from web sites to applications to programming networks required to become an IT consultant. And I think by working in a group project, I would be able to learn Great communication and leadership skills, quick learner, good listener, confident decision making etc. which are necessary to become an IT consultant.
