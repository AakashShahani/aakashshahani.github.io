									<h2>Personal Information</h2>
									<p>). I’m Aakash Shahani, an 18 year old boy pursuing his bachelor of information technology at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia. My student number and email address are s3759927 and aakashshahani42@gmail.com respectively.. I’m basically from India and my last education was 12th year   and in addition to this I had done C-Programming course from India. As India is the country of cultures and people have different cultures and as per me the culture refers to anything like the way of behaving with other, respecting other religions, tradition of arts, festivals, fairs, dance music are also included in our culture.  In addition to that, many different languages are spoken in different religion and caste. I belong to the Hindu religion, but my caste is Sindhi. So, I have been speaking Sindhi, Hindi, Guajarati and English (As I studied in Convent School) languages since from my childhood. And I had being passionate about football and cricket in sports and I can refer them as my hobby and from the last year I had started reading books on autobiography. They work as a stressbuster for me So, playing sports and reading new books are something that I can’t think life without.</p>

									<h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</h3>
									<p>From the last few decades, computerization and digitalization has been increasing tremendously. Further, the world wide web, refer as the global information system is loaded with a lot of data and information. In my school life also, I was way ahead at computers, so my teachers motivated and suggested me to choose information technology as a career. They explained me by present scenario of online banking transaction is the good example of the need of secure information system. As the time passed my interest and thirst to attain further education in information technology grew. So, now I am starting my career in Information Technology is because of my school teacher who found that I could do this, and she knew that I had interest in IT.</p>
								</section>
								<section..
									
									<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
									<p>I know as the selection of right candidate is important for the university so is for the student to select the correct university. So of course, such major decisioncannot be taken in haste. No doubt, the name RMIT University is enough, but I got the momentum by information from a senior, and a few well-wishers. As I found RMIT University’s undergraduate program in Information technology covers all subjects which I am interested most. However, I must say the real magnet was the research of Professor Ellie Rennie on Cyber safety in remote Aboriginal communities, which I think would undoubtedly help me in strengthening my understanding of cyber security and its’ applications. The quality that has attracted me a lot about your university is, it creates management and leadership qualities necessary to advance career options. The best research facilities, eminent faculty and the vibrant atmosphere of the university have really astonished me.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									
									<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
									<p>I want to acquire all the skills to solve, support, troubleshoot and design, everything from web sites to programming networks required to become an IT consultant. And I think by working in a group project, I would be able to learn Great communication and leadership skills, quick learner, good listener, confident decision making etc. which are necessary to become an IT consultant.</p>

									<h3>A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.</h3>
									<p>The main skill for the position of an IT consultant is a great communication skill and the deep knowledge about the software, media and hardware.

							<h2>PROJECT IDEA</h2>
							<p>Smart Health Monitoring Application </p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
						                          <h3>Overview </h3>
									  <p>The Health Monitoring application would focus on maintaining the health of people and advising them to achieve their goal. This would include diet monitoring, diet suggestions, footstep monitoring, sleep suggestion, water alarm. This application is for all the people who want to maintain their health without going to the gym. This app would be giving free trail for 1-2 months to all their user.

								</section>
								<section..
									
									  <h3> Description </h3>
									  <p>The application would be available free for all the user who wants to keep monitor on their health whether he is young or old. Once the application gets installed on the device, he/she must have to register themselves with email and would have to enter their personal details, height, weight and their goal. After that, user must answer some basic questions about their health, if they might have any serious health issues. So accordingly, they would be provided their schedule. The user can see their profile anytime and can update his physical attributes which also effect on their routine.
When the user opens the application, they would have to click on the start button to count their daily footsteps, calories in food, hours of sleep, how many glasses of water user drinks. And after observing few days of the user, system calculates the daily take of the user in 3 criteria’s: Proteins, Fats and Carbohydrates. The User must enter their daily intakes so that system can calculate how much he/she has consumed and how much he/she should take. The system has stored some food items calories, carbs, proteins in the database but the user can add new food items which will help the system to monitor the user diets. And the system would notify daily that how much the user had to walk in a day and how many calories they would have to take or burn depends on the user’s aim. For instance, if the user wants to gain some weight and he is willing to follow nutritional diet and he/she is not having some healthy grocery mentioned in the diet. So, the app can access device location and find him/her the nearby store where he/she can get the products.

Every week the user can see his progress and status and for keeping them motivated they would get rewarded with some discount coupons or could get free health checkup at the prescribed stores. But this is only for the people who are serious about following all the prescribed activities time to time and are half way to their aim. Others gets some voucher for having started doing something for their health. The interesting fact about this application is that the user can sets alarm to get notified for something they want. Like the System tells the user how much water the user should intake and alarms him by notifying him about how much water he should have been consumed till now. They can set alarm for everything they want.
 
System also suggest the user about hours of sleep he/she should take for the healthy life style. But if the user changes/updates something in their attributes, the output also changes accordingly. So, the user must enter correct details to get right output. And the user needs an active internet connection to use this application. User can have control over when they want to start their footstep counting, when to set alarm and when to get notified. </p>
